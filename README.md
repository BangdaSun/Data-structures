## Data-structures
I took COMS W3134 Data Structures in Java in 17 spring semester, which is a required course for Computer Science related major students at Columbia University. This course is taught by Professor Paul Blaer. It was a really fun class.

The topics dicussed in this course includes:

### General Concepts
Abstract Data types; 
Basic proofs by induction;
Recursion.

### Basic Java Concepts
Java OOP;
Generic programming;
Inner classes;
Iterator;
Comparable.

### Analysis of Algorithms
Big-O notation;
Growth of functions.

### List
ArrayList;
LinkedList.

### Stacks and Queues

### Trees
Binary Tree;
Binary Search Tree;
AVL Tree.

### Hash Table

### Priority Queues
Binary Heap.

### Sorting Algorithms
Selection Sort;
Insertion Sort;
Heap Sort;
Merge Sort;
Quick Sort.

### Graphs
Graph theory;
Shorest paths and Dijsktra's Algorithm;
Minimum Spanning Tree - Prim's Algorithm and Kruskal Algorithm;
TSP problem (Nearest Neighbor Approximation, Brute Force Solution);
P vs NP and NP-completeness.
